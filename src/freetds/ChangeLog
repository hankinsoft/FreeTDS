    Avoid to strip spaces from procedure text.

    NTBSTRINGBIND strip spaces at the end.
    Using STRINGBIND with 0 size cause string to be just NUL terminated.
    The 0 would lead to a possible overflow however we check the column
    len before doing the bind to avoid such possibility.

    Original patch from Nem W Schlecht.

    do not compile as bundle under Mac OS X is --with-odbc-nodm is specified

    In this case the driver will be used as a dynamic library (not loaded
    dynamically) so compile as such.
    In case a DM is used unit tests/application will link to the DM which
    will load the driver (requiring to be a module on old Mac OS X versions).
